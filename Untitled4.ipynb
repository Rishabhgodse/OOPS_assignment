        "Abstraction: This concept hides complex implementation details and shows only the essential features of an object. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",

        "Inheritance: It allows a new class (child class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (parent class). This promotes code reusability.\n",

        "Polymorphism: This allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the use of a single interface to represent different types of objects.\n",
